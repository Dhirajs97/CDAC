1) Which field of the Customers table is the primary key?
=> CNUM	

2) What is the 4th column of the Customers table?
=> RATING

3) What is another word for row? For column?
=> Row can be called as Tuple or Entity.
Column can be called as Attribute or Key.

4) Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
=> When we insert a large number of rows, the rows get inserted where they get the space, so the insertion order is not maintained.
Rows of the table are scattered all over the database Server HD.
