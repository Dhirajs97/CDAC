-----------------------------------------------------------

1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named
Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).

mysql> select * from Orders where Cnum = (select cnum from Customers where Cname = 'Cisneros');
+------+---------+------------+------+------+
| Onum | Amt     | Odate      | Cnum | Snum |
+------+---------+------------+------+------+
| 3001 |   18.69 | 1990-10-03 | 2008 | 1007 |
| 3006 | 1098.16 | 1990-10-03 | 2008 | 1007 |
+------+---------+------------+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)

2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have
above-average orders.

mysql> select distinct cust.Cname, cust.Rating from Customers cust join Orders ord on cust.Cnum = ord.Cnum where ord.Amt > (select avg(Amt) from Orders);
+---------+--------+
| Cname   | Rating |
+---------+--------+
| Liu     |    200 |
| Clemens |    100 |
+---------+--------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select Cname, Rating from customers where Cnum IN (select Cnum from Orders group by Cnum having Avg(Amt) > (select avg(Amt) from Orders));
+---------+--------+
| Cname   | Rating |
+---------+--------+
| Liu     |    200 |
| Clemens |    100 |
+---------+--------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.

mysql> select Snum, sum(Amt) from Orders group by Snum having  sum(Amt) > (select max(Amt) from Orders);
+------+----------+
| Snum | sum(Amt) |
+------+----------+
| 1001 | 15382.07 |
+------+----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
